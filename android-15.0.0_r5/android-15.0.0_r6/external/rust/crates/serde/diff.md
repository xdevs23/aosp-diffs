++TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
++
++1. Definitions.
++
++   "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
++   and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
++
++   "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
++   the copyright owner that is granting the License.
++
++   "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
++   other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
++   control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
++   "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
++   direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
++   otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
++   outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
++
++   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
++   exercising permissions granted by this License.
++
++   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
++   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
++   source, and configuration files.
++
++   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
++   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
++   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
++   and conversions to other media types.
++
++   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
++   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
++   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
++   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
++
++   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
++   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
++   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
++   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
++   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
++   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
++   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
++
++   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
++   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
++   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
++   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
++   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
++   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
++   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
++   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
++   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
++   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
++   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
++   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
++   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
++
++   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
++   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
++   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
++
++2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
++   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
++   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
++   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
++   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
++   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
++
++3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
++   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
++   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
++   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
++   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
++   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
++   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
++   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
++   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
++   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
++   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
++   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
++   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
++   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
++   as of the date such litigation is filed.
++
++4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
++   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
++   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
++   meet the following conditions:
++
++   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
++       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
++
++   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
++       stating that You changed the files; and
++
++   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
++       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
++       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
++       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
++       the Derivative Works; and
++
++   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
++       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
++       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
++       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
++       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
++       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
++       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
++       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
++       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
++       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
++       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
++       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
++       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
++       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
++       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
++       as modifying the License.
++
++   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
++   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
++   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
++   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
++   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
++   the conditions stated in this License.
++
++5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
++   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
++   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
++   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
++   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
++   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
++   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
++
++6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
++   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
++   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
++   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
++
++7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
++   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
++   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
++   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
++   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
++   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
++   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
++   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
++   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
++
++8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
++   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
++   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
++   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
++   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
++   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
++   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
++   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
++   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
++   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
++   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
++
++9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
++   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
++   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
++   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
++   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
++   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
++   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
++   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
++   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
++   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
