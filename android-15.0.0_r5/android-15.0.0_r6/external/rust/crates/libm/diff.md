-// Added automatically by a large-scale-change that took the approach of
-// 'apply every license found to every target'. While this makes sure we respect
-// every license restriction, it may not be entirely correct.
-//
-// e.g. GPL in an MIT project might only apply to the contrib/ directory.
-//
-// Please consider splitting the single license below into multiple licenses,
-// taking care not to lose any license_kind information, and overriding the
-// default license using the 'licenses: [...]' property on targets as needed.
-//
-// For unused files, consider creating a 'fileGroup' with "//visibility:private"
-// to attach the license to, and including a comment whether the files may be
-// used in the current project.
-//
-// large-scale-change included anything that looked like it might be a license
-// text as a license_text. e.g. LICENSE, NOTICE, COPYING etc.
-//
-// Please consider removing redundant or irrelevant files from 'license_text:'.
